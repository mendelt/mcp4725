//! *Microchip MCP4725 DAC Driver for Rust Embedded HAL*
//! This is a driver crate for embedded Rust. It's built on top of the Rust
//! [embedded HAL](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal)
//! It supports sending commands to a MCP4725 DAC over I2C.
//! To get started you can look at the
//! [examples](https://github.com/mendelt/mcp4725/tree/master/bluepill-examples/examples)
//! on how to use this driver on an inexpensive blue pill STM32F103 board.
//!
//! The driver can be initialized by calling create and passing it an I2C interface. The three least
//! significant bits of the device address (A2, A1 and A0) also need to be specified. A2 and A1 are
//! set in the device. A0 can be set by pulling the corresponding connection on the device high or
//! low.
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal_mock::i2c::Mock;
//! # use mcp4725::*;
//! # let mut i2c = Mock::new(&[]);
//! let mut dac = MCP4725::new(i2c, 0b010);
//! ```
//!
//! To set the dac output and powermode the dac register can be set;
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal_mock::i2c::{Mock, Transaction};
//! # use mcp4725::*;
//! # let mut i2c = Mock::new(&[Transaction::write(98, vec![0x40, 0xff, 0xf0]),]);
//! # let mut dac = MCP4725::new(i2c, 0b010);
//! dac.set_dac(PowerDown::Normal, 0x0fff);
//! ```
//!
//! The MCP4725 has a built in eeprom that is used to initialize the dac register on power up.
//! The values in the eeprom can be set with the `set_dac_and_eeprom` method;
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal_mock::i2c::{Mock, Transaction};
//! # use mcp4725::*;
//! # let mut i2c = Mock::new(&[Transaction::write(98, vec![0x64, 0xff, 0xf0])]);
//! # let mut dac = MCP4725::new(i2c, 0b010);
//! dac.set_dac_and_eeprom(PowerDown::Resistor100kOhm, 0x0fff);
//! ```
